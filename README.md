### 👋 Hi, I’m Mansi Mishra

⚡ equal parts coder, product tinkerer, and habitual over-caffeinator.

🛠 Speak fluent Python, conversational JS, and broken Bash.

🤖 Build things that talk, listen, draw graphs, and occasionally file their own bug reports.

⚡ Projects range from chatbots & TTS pipelines to data-wrangling dashboards and whatever shiny idea shows up next.

🏋️‍♀️ Balancing pull requests with pull-ups (both hit failure sets eventually).

💌 Ping me for collabs, dad jokes in regex, or the perfect “scope-creep” emoji.
