### 👋 Hi, I’m Mansi Mishra

⚡ equal parts coder, product tinkerer, and habitual over-caffeinator.

🛠 Speak fluent Python, conversational JS, and broken Bash.

🤖 Build things that talk, listen, draw graphs, and occasionally file their own bug reports.

⚡ Projects range from chatbots & TTS pipelines to data-wrangling dashboards and whatever shiny idea shows up next.

🏋️‍♀️ Balancing pull requests with pull-ups (both hit failure sets eventually).

💌 Ping me for collabs, dad jokes in regex, or the perfect “scope-creep” emoji.


I'm passionate about building intelligent, human-like AI experiences — from GenAI-powered chatbots to dynamic TTS systems. My work spans the intersection of NLP, LLMs, and voice interfaces.
🛠️ Tech I Use: Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Streamlit, React, Coqui TTS, ElevenLabs, GPT-4, ffmpeg

📚 I believe good AI feels intuitive — like a helpful, respectful human. I'm here to build exactly that.
